# Bitcoin Development with Go

This little guide book is to serve as a general help guide for anyone wanting to develop Bitcoin applications using the Go programming language. It's meant to provide a starting point if you're already pretty familiar with Bitcoin and Go but don't know where to to start on bringing it all together. You'll learn how to perform general blockchain tasks like generating wallets, transferring Bitcoin, and queries the blockchain using Golang.

This book is composed of many examples that I wish I had encountered before when I first started doing Bitcoin development with Go. This book will walk you through most things that you should be aware of in order for you to be a productive Bitcoin developer using Go.

If you see something out-of-date or invalid, I strongly suggest opening an [issue](https://github.com/miguelmota/bitcoin-development-with-go-book/issues) or making a [pull request](https://github.com/miguelmota/bitcoin-development-with-go-book/pulls) if you observe things that can be improved. This book is completely open and free and available on [github](https://github.com/miguelmota/bitcoin-development-with-go-book).
